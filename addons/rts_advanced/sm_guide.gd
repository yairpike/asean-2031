static func controls_hint() -> String:
	return "Left-click select. Shift-click adds. Double-click or E selects that type. Right-click ground to move, an enemy to attack. Shift-right-click adds a waypoint. Z lines the company up. Q attack-move. X halt. R moves the rally flag. Ctrl+1-9 stores a group, the number recalls it. A ring marks the order. Click the minimap to jump. F ability. H guide. P opens protocols."

static func howto_text() -> String:
	return "Left-click a unit, or drag a box around your company. An orange ring shows that unit's weapon range.\nRight-click open ground to move. Right-click an enemy to attack. A ring marks that spot, then fades.\nPress Q to attack-move toward the cursor. Press X to halt. Ctrl and 1 through 9 stores a group. Press the number to recall it, and press it again to center the camera.\nShift-click adds a unit. Ctrl-click toggles it. Double-click, or E, selects every unit of that type. Z lines the company up for the next move. Shift-right-click on open ground adds another step. R plants the rally flag, and new units appear beside it. The top bar shows credits gained per second.\nA diamond sits on the lead unit's next step. A tall marker stands on the current objective, and the minimap frames that spot. Hits show a floating number.\nClick the minimap to jump the camera there.\nPress F, or Ability, to use the selected unit's power. Smart-cast fires only the closest ready unit.\nThe column on the right trains units and raises buildings. Walk onto a colored pad to claim it.\nBoats cross deep water. Tanks and infantry stay on land, and they use a shallow ford when one is open.\nMonsoon mud slows tanks and infantry. Strait Haze shortens sight unless a hydro radar is yours. On the Mekong, right-click a bridge to bring it down and open the canal. A captured arms bazaar sells CH-4, Su-30, Orlan-10, and the FLH7 Squad, and skims the enemy purse.\nLow power stops new production until a plant covers the draw. Cancel drops the building in progress. A hydro radar lights the river corridor.\nP opens protocols. H opens this guide.\nThe status line reads Objective complete when you win, and Objective failed if your company dies."
